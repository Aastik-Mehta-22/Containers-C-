# Containers Library

It is the generic collection of class templates and algorithms that allow programmers to easily implement the common data structures like queues, lists, and stacks.

## There are 3 classes for containers

### 1. Sequence  
These containers implement data structures which can be accessed sequentially.

### 2. Associative  
These containers implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched O(log(n)) Complexity.

### 3. Unordered Associative Containers  
These containers implement unsorted (hashed) data structures O(1) average and O(n) worst time complexity.

## Containers Management

Containers manage the storage space that is allocated for its elements and provide member functions to access them either directly or through iterators (objects that have properties similar to pointers).

## Common Functionality

Most containers have at least several member functions in common, and share functionalities. Which container is the best for the particular application depends not only on the offered functionality, but also on its efficiency in how it works with different workloads.
